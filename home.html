        <h4>Education is a human right and a crucial resource. Literacy improves health, income, and 
            livelihood, but in 2012 the Global Partnership for Education estimated that 61 million 
            children across the globe do not attend schools. These children find themselves disadvantaged. 
            Without access to learning, they become trapped in the generational cycle of poverty suffered by 
            their families and those before them. The same report noted that even when children in lesser developed 
            countries go to school, the quality of their learning leaves them many grades behind the students of 
            wealthier nations.

        <h4>Basic needs like pencils, pens, paper, and textbooks help students engage in lessons, as they 
            gain knowledge they can bring back to their community to improve overall welfare. Projects in 
            school can translate into better lives for families in extreme poverty. A student can learn to 
            research hygiene from a textbook, and share this information, reducing disease and increasing 
            life expectancy. A child can learn to use a pencil and paper to manage finances and plan for new 
            sources of income. Education and its resources encourage a lifetime of problem-solving for young learners.
